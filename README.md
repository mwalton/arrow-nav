####Getting the source (Making Android, Github & eclipse play nice together)  
1.  In ADT, select __File > Import__ select __“Git” > “Projects from Git”__
2.  Select “URI”.  click next
3.  Enter: `git@github.com:mwalton/cycle-nav.git` in the URI field

*__NOTE:__ DO NOT clone the source into your eclipse/ADT workspace.  Put it in some other folder (eg ../home/git/ ).  We will then be adding a reference to this location in your workspace.  (This is a safety measure because eclipse can easily mess up the repo if it is in the workspace)*
