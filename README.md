####Getting the source (Making Android, Github & eclipse play nice together)  
1.  In ADT, select __File > Import__ select __“Git” > “Projects from Git”__
2.  Select “URI”.  click next
3.  Enter: `git@github.com:mwalton/cycle-nav.git` in the URI field
4.  Select all branches
5.  Choose where on your machine you want to put the repo. click next
6.  Follow any additional prompts with default settings.
7.  You now have the project source!!

*__NOTE:__ DO NOT clone the source into your eclipse/ADT workspace.  Put it in some other folder (eg ../home/git/ ).  We will then be adding a reference to this location in your workspace.  (This is a safety measure because eclipse can easily mess up the repo if it is in the workspace)*
